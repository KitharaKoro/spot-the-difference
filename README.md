# spot-the-difference

This is Spot the Difference, the classic game where you have to find the differences between 2 images.

Originally coded in 2009 on Java 6, I am guessing several GUI objects have been modified or depreciated, so I doubt this will run well on Java 8.

I'll be untangling the code when I get the chance.

Also, this was coded when object names reflected my mood rather than the object itself.
